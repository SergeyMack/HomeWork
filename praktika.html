        <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
        <h2 style="color: grey;">A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</h2>
        <h3 id="code1"><span id="codeinside">ax + b = 0</span></h3>
        <h3>
        <pre><i>
    Where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation.
    Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
    Also, the variable may or may not be an <span>x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span>x</span> there.

        <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
        <h2 style="color: gray;">The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</h2>
        <h3 id="code2"><span id="codeinside2">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></h3>
        <h2>
            <pre><i>
where <span>a</span>, <span>b</span>, <span>c</span> are known values and <span>x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span>a</span> can't be 0.
